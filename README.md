The test code runs on either Chrome or Firefox. They can be tested after the other, 
however, the test cases would have been redundant if such was a case. As mentioned 
in the previous section, either driver can be toggled on or off by commenting out 
or commenting in related codes.


Additionally, if the web page gives an error about javascript or Google Maps API,
Google Maps API should be activated from the links provided by the error which can
be accessed from the Inspect/Developer Mode on the page. Currently, the API has an expiry data of around 6 months on a free trial basis.

Same can be said for the web drivers for both Chrome and Firefox, to run the test
code correctly.
